# Getting Started

To run this project locally, follow these steps:

1. **MongoDB:**
   
   If MongoDB is not already installed on your machine, follow the official MongoDB installation guide for your operating system:
   - [MongoDB Installation Guide](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/installation/)

   Ensure MongoDB is running before proceeding to start the Node.js server.

2. **Install Dependencies:**

   Open your terminal and navigate to the project directory. Run the following command to install the necessary dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
   
This command will install all required packages specified in `package.json`.

3. **Start the Server:**

Once the dependencies are installed, start the Node.js server. Run the following command:
```bash
   node main.js
```
This command will start the server locally on port `3000`.

4. **Access the Application:**

Open your web browser and navigate to http://localhost:3000 to access the application.

That's it! You should now have the application up and running locally on your machine.
